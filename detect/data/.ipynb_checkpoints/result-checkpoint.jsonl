To combat this move by the cigarette companies, the Federal Communications Commission required television stations to air anti-smoking advertisements at no cost to the organizations providing such advertisements.

The \"evening star\" and \"clear evening bell\" symbolize guidance and a call to the journey, respectively.

{"id": "test34", "query": "difference between single layer perceptron and multilayer perceptron", "human_answer": "The term \"multilayer perceptron\" does not refer to a single perceptron that has multiple layers. Rather, it contains many perceptrons that are organized into layers. An alternative is \"multilayer perceptron network\". Moreover, MLP \"perceptrons\" are not perceptrons in the strictest possible sense. True perceptrons are formally a special case of artificial neurons that use a threshold activation function such as the Heaviside step function. MLP perceptrons can employ arbitrary activation functions. A true perceptron performs binary classification (either this or that), an MLP neuron is free to either perform classification or regression, depending upon its activation function.", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "A single layer perceptron is the simplest form of a neural network, consisting of only one layer of input nodes that directly feed into the output node. It can only solve linearly separable problems, meaning it can only classify data sets that can be separated by a single line or plane. \n\nOn the other hand, a multilayer perceptron consists of multiple layers of nodes in a directed graph, with each layer fully connected to the next one. This structure allows it to solve more complex problems that are not linearly separable, as it can model complex relationships between inputs and outputs. The multilayer perceptron includes an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The hidden layers allow the network to learn through backpropagation, adjusting the weights of the nodes based on the error of the output."}

The locals, who admired him, raced out in their boats to save him or at least retrieve his body. This is said to have been the origin of dragon boat races.

He then became a man with a mission; he dreamed of building an orphanage for street children, hoping to save them from becoming the kind of person he used to be. Lacking the necessary funds to achieve his dream, King entered the first King of Iron Fist Tournament, in order to obtain them.

It was adopted on December 15, 1791, along with nine other amendments, to ensure certain freedoms and rights to the citizens of America. The First Amendment states that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"\n\nThe history of the First Amendment is rooted in the early struggles of the American colonies against British rule, where restrictions on speech and the press were common. The framers of the Constitution, therefore, sought to ensure these freedoms were protected in the new republic.\n\nThe meaning of the First Amendment is multifaceted. It guarantees five fundamental freedoms: freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to assemble, and the right to petition the government. Freedom of religion is twofold—it prevents the government from establishing a national religion and ensures individuals the freedom to practice any religion. Freedom of speech and the press allows individuals to express their thoughts and ideas without government interference. The right to assemble and petition the government gives citizens the ability to gather for peaceful purposes and to seek changes from the government. These freedoms are considered the cornerstone of American democracy."}

During the peak of the kingdom, Mali was extremely wealthy. This was due to the tax on trade in and out of the empire, along with all the gold Mansa Musa had. He had so much gold that during his hajj to Mecca, the Mansa passed out gold to all the poor along the way. This led to inflation throughout the kingdom. Mansa Musa also ran out of gold on the hajj to Mecca but was not concerned because he knew he had enough gold back in Mali to pay back everything he owed money to. Trade was a significant factor to the rise and success of Mali. Mali flourished especially when Timbuktu came under Mansa Musa’s control. Timbuktu was a place of trade, entertainment, and education. The city’s water supply was a leading cause to its successes in trade.[44] Mansa Musa placed a heavy tax on all objects that went through Timbuktu. Although this time in the kingdom was prosperous, Mali’s wealth and power soon declined. Mali was thriving for a long time, but like other western pre-colonial kingdom, Mali began to fall. Constant civil war between leaders led to a weakened state. These conflicts also interrupted trade. This is one of the main factors to the fall of the kingdom. Trade was Mali’s form of income, and wealth. With trade being disrupted by wars, there was no way for the economy to continue to prosper. As a result of this the empire fell.

{"id": "test100", "query": "why do red blood cells live for only 120 days", "human_answer": "The aging red blood cell undergoes changes in its plasma membrane, making it susceptible to selective recognition by macrophages and subsequent phagocytosis in the mononuclear phagocyte system (spleen, liver and lymph nodes), thus removing old and defective cells and continually purging the blood. This process is termed eryptosis, red blood cell programmed cell death.[47] This process normally occurs at the same rate of production by erythropoiesis, balancing the total circulating red blood cell count. Eryptosis is increased in a wide variety of diseases including sepsis, haemolytic uremic syndrome, malaria, sickle cell anemia, beta-thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, phosphate depletion, iron deficiency and Wilson's disease. Eryptosis can be elicited by osmotic shock, oxidative stress, energy depletion as well as a wide variety of endogenous mediators and xenobiotics. Excessive eryptosis is observed in red blood cells lacking the cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I or the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK. Inhibitors of eryptosis include erythropoietin, nitric oxide, catecholamines and high concentrations of urea.", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "Red blood cells, also known as erythrocytes, live for only about 120 days due to their structure and function. They lack a nucleus and other organelles, which means they cannot repair themselves or reproduce. Their primary function is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and then carry carbon dioxide back to the lungs. This constant work leads to wear and tear. After about 120 days, they are broken down and recycled in the spleen. The liver and bone marrow then produce new red blood cells to replace them."}

{"id": "test130", "query": "what is the center of heredity in a cell", "human_answer": "Cell nuclei contain most of the cell's genetic material, organized as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins, such as histones, to form chromosomes. The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome and are structured in such a way to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expressionâ€”the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope, a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm, and the nuclear matrix (which includes the nuclear lamina), a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the cytoskeleton, which supports the cell as a whole.", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "The center of heredity in a cell is the nucleus. This is because it houses the cell's chromosomes, which are made up of DNA. DNA carries the genetic information for making all the proteins required by all organisms for their growth and development.

{"id": "test162", "query": "what is the average time in hospice care", "human_answer": "Many physicians are slow to refer to hospice care, waiting until they are absolutely certain of a terminal prognosis. Some physicians believe that the patient must have a six-month prognosis or less to receive hospice care, while others are overly optimistic in their assessment of prognosis, presuming treatment will be more effective than it is.[27][28] As a result, the majority of patients are referred to hospice in the very end-stages of their diseases, or choose that time to seek hospice care. The average length of stay in hospice before a patient dies was 26 days in 1994 and 19 days in 1998.[29] Although the length of average stays has since increased, the term of care continues to be underused. In 2004 the average stay was 57 days and the median length was 22 days.[30] 33% of hospice patients admitted in 2004 died within seven days of admission.[31]", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "The average length of time a patient spends in hospice care varies, but according to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, in the United States, the median length of service is about 24 days. This means that half of the patients receive hospice care for longer, and half for less time. However, it's important to note that hospice care can last six months or more depending on the patient's health condition."}

{"id": "test166", "query": "where are the cardiac and vasomotor centers found", "human_answer": "The vasomotor center (VMC) is a portion of the medulla oblongata that, together with the cardiovascular center and respiratory center, regulates blood pressure and other homeostatic processes. Vasomotor center is a fairly archaic term since this function relies not on a single brain structure (\"center\") but rather represents a presympathetic network of interacting neurons.[1] Upon increase in carbon dioxide level at central chemoreceptors, it stimulates the sympathetic system to constrict vessels. This is opposite to carbon dioxide in tissues causing vasodilatation, especially in the brain.[2] Cranial nerves IX (Glossopharyngeal nerve) and X Vagus nerve both feed into the vasomotor centre and are themselves involved in the regulation of blood pressure. The localization of VMC was determined by Filipp Ovsyannikov in 1871.[3]", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "The cardiac and vasomotor centers are found in the medulla oblongata of the brain.

Unlike Lamarck, Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life, meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor. Darwin based his theory on the idea of natural selection: it synthesized a broad range of evidence from animal husbandry, biogeography, geology, morphology, and embryology. Debate over Darwin's work led to the rapid acceptance of the general concept of evolution, but the specific mechanism he proposed, natural selection, was not widely accepted until it was revived by developments in biology that occurred during the 1920s through the 1940s. Before that time most biologists regarded other factors as responsible for evolution. Alternatives to natural selection suggested during \"the eclipse of Darwinism\" (c. 1880 to 1920) included inheritance of acquired characteristics (neo-Lamarckism), an innate drive for change (orthogenesis), and sudden large mutations (saltationism). Mendelian genetics, a series of 19th-century experiments with pea plant variations rediscovered in 1900, was integrated with natural selection by Ronald Fisher, J. B. S. Haldane, and Sewall Wright during the 1910s to 1930s, and resulted in the founding of the new discipline of population genetics.

In other languages, semicolons are called terminators[14] and are required after every statement (such as in Java, and the C family). Today semicolons as terminators has largely won out, but this was a divisive issue in programming languages from the 1960s into the 1980s.[15] An influential and frequently-cited study in this debate was Gannon & Horning (1975), which concluded strongly in favor of semicolon as a terminator:", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "In a C statement, the semicolon (;) is used as a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon to indicate the end of one logical entity. It is a way to tell the compiler that the line of code has ended and anything that follows is a new statement or instruction. Without the semicolon, the compiler may interpret the next line as a continuation of the previous statement, which can lead to syntax errors."}

Проект относится к разговору в середине 1865 года между де Лабуле, убежденным аболиционистом, и Фредериком Бартольди, скульптором. Во время обеденного разговора у себя дома недалеко от Версаля, Лабуле, ярый сторонник Союза во время Гражданской войны в США, якобы сказал: \"Если в Соединенных Штатах должен возвестись памятник в честь их независимости, я считаю естественным, если он будет построен объединенными усилиями - общим трудом обеих наших наций.\" Национальная служба парков, однако, в отчете 2000 года признала это легендой, прослеживаемой до брошюры для сбора средств 1885 года, и что статуя, скорее всего, была задумана в 1870 году. В другом эссе на их сайте, служба парков предположила, что Лабуле хотел почтить победу Союза и ее последствия: \"С отменой рабства и победой Союза в Гражданской войне в 1865 году, желания Лабуле о свободе и демократии становились реальностью в Соединенных Штатах. Чтобы почтить эти достижения, Лабуле предложил построить подарок для Соединенных Штатов от имени Франции.

Active transport is usually associated with accumulating high concentrations of molecules that the cell needs, such as ions, glucose and amino acids. If the process uses chemical energy, such as from adenosine triphosphate (ATP), it is termed primary active transport. Secondary active transport involves the use of an electrochemical gradient. Examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose in the intestines in humans and the uptake of mineral ions into root hair cells of plants.[1]", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "Active transport performs the function of moving molecules across a cell membrane from a region of their lower concentration to a region of their higher concentration.

The gap between the two flasks is partially evacuated of air, creating a partial-vacuum which reduces heat conduction or convection. Heat transfer by thermal radiation may be minimized by silvering flask surfaces facing the gap but can become problematic if the flask's contents or surroundings are very hot; hence vacuum flasks usually hold contents below the boiling point of water. Most heat transfer occurs through the neck and opening of the flask, where there is no vacuum. Vacuum flasks are usually made of metal, borosilicate glass, foam or plastic and have their opening stoppered with cork or polyethylene plastic. Vacuum flasks are often used as insulated shipping containers.", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "The walls of a thermos flask are silvered to reduce heat transfer by radiation.

{"id": "test223", "query": "why the hole in the ozone layer over antarctica", "human_answer": "The main cause of ozone depletion and the ozone hole is man-made chemicals, especially man-made halocarbon refrigerants, solvents, propellants, and foam-blowing agents (chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs), HCFCs, halons), referred to as ozone-depleting substances (ODS). These compounds are transported into the stratosphere by the winds after being emitted at the surface.[2] Once in the stratosphere, they release halogen atoms through photodissociation, which catalyze the breakdown of ozone (O3) into oxygen (O2).[3] Both types of ozone depletion were observed to increase as emissions of halocarbons increased.", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "The hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica is primarily caused by human-made chemicals containing chlorine and bromine. These chemicals are found in certain industrial applications and products, such as refrigerants, aerosols, and air conditioning systems. When these chemicals are released into the atmosphere, they can reach the stratosphere, where they are broken down by solar radiation and release chlorine and bromine molecules. These molecules then participate in reactions that destroy ozone molecules. The process is particularly intense over Antarctica due to its extremely cold temperatures and unique atmospheric conditions, which create an ideal environment for these reactions to occur. This leads to the formation of the \"ozone hole\" every Antarctic spring."}

In humans, red blood cells are produced by cores of bone marrow in the heads of long bones in a process known as hematopoiesis.[2] On average, bone marrow constitutes 4% of the total body mass of humans; in an adult having 65 kilograms of mass (143 lb), bone marrow typically accounts for approximately 2.6 kilograms (5.7Â lb). The hematopoietic component of bone marrow produces approximately 500 billion blood cells per day, which use the bone marrow vasculature as a conduit to the body's systemic circulation.[3] Bone marrow is also a key component of the lymphatic system, producing the lymphocytes that support the body's immune system.[4] In addition to hematopoietic cells, the marrow is composed of marrow adipose tissue as well as trabecular bone. The interplay between these different cell types and the local factors they produce can have an effect on hematopoietic cells within the hematopoietic stem cell niche.", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "The function of red bone marrow is primarily to produce blood cells. It is a soft, spongy tissue found in the center of large bones, such as the hip and thigh bones. Red bone marrow contains stem cells, which are immature cells that can develop into red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout the body, white blood cells that fight infections, and platelets that help with blood clotting. As we age, some of the red bone marrow is replaced by yellow bone marrow, which stores fat.

{"id": "test253", "query": "what is fate of ovum after ovulation of menstrual cycle", "human_answer": "Ovulation is the release of eggs from the ovaries. In humans, this event occurs when the follicles rupture and release the secondary oocyte ovarian cells.[1] After ovulation, during the luteal phase, the egg will be available to be fertilized by sperm. In addition, the uterine lining (endometrium) is thickened to be able to receive a fertilized egg. If no conception occurs, the uterine lining as well as blood will be shed during menstruation.[2]", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "After ovulation during the menstrual cycle, the fate of the ovum (egg) can vary. If the ovum is fertilized by a sperm, it may implant in the uterus and develop into a fetus, leading to pregnancy. If the ovum is not fertilized within about 24 hours after ovulation, it will degenerate and be reabsorbed by the body. This will then trigger the menstrual phase of the cycle, where the lining of the uterus is shed through the vagina."}

Fearful that he may have missed his chance with Susan, Mark attempts to convey his attraction towards her upon her return, though he cannot find the courage to follow through and is left perplexed by Susan's reticence.

This occurs as a result of activation of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors by norepinephrine released by post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons. These receptors exist throughout the vasculature of the body but are inhibited and counterbalanced by beta-2 adrenergic receptors (stimulated by epinephrine release from the adrenal glands) in the skeletal muscles, the heart, the lungs, and the brain during a sympathoadrenal response. The net effect of this is a shunting of blood away from the organs not necessary to the immediate survival of the organism and an increase in blood flow to those organs involved in intense physical activity.", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "The adrenal gland produces a hormone called adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, which is necessary for the sympathetic nervous system to function. This hormone prepares the body for a 'fight or flight' response by increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and energy supplies.

When Reformers set out to translate the King James Bible, they assumed that a Greek manuscript they possessed was ancient and therefore adopted the phrase \"For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever\" into the Lord’s Prayer.

The Han Chinese had hempen-bound bamboo scrolls to write on, yet by the 2nd century AD had invented the papermaking process which created a writing medium that was both cheap and easy to produce. The invention of the wheelbarrow aided in the hauling of heavy loads. The maritime junk ship and stern-mounted steering rudder enabled the Chinese to venture out of calmer waters of interior lakes and rivers and into the open sea. The invention of the grid reference for maps and raised-relief map allowed the Chinese to better navigate their terrain. In medicine, they used new herbal remedies to cure illnesses, calisthenics to keep physically fit, and regulated diets to avoid diseases. Authorities in the capital were warned ahead of time of the direction of sudden earthquakes with the invention of the seismometer that was tripped by a vibration-sensitive pendulum device. To mark the passing of the seasons and special occasions, the Han Chinese used two variations of the lunisolar calendar, which were established due to efforts in astronomy and mathematics. Han-era Chinese advancements in mathematics include the discovery of square roots, cube roots, the Pythagorean theorem, Gaussian elimination, the Horner scheme, improved calculations of pi, and negative numbers. Hundreds of new roads and canals were built to facilitate transport, commerce, tax collection, communication, and movement of military troops.

The Han Dynasty also made significant advancements in science and technology. They invented the seismoscope, an instrument used to detect earthquakes, and improved the process of papermaking, which greatly facilitated the spread of knowledge. In the field of medicine, they compiled the \"Huangdi Neijing,\" one of the most important classical texts in traditional Chinese medicine. Additionally, the Han Dynasty saw the development of Confucianism as the official state philosophy, which greatly influenced Chinese society and other East Asian cultures.

(The significance of this street drug does not become clear until later.) Harley goes into a rough bar and sees a cowboy-looking fellow (Don Johnson wearing a beard, cowboy hat and boots). He has scammed a fellow in a pool game but has to use strong measures when the fellow refuses payment. Harley helps him in this. We learn that they are old friends (later we learn the name he goes by is The Marlboro Man.) They visit a blues (old jazz?) bar in Burbank, which they both hold special. They go into a back room and meet Jack Daniels, an extremely-heavily-muscled lad, who immediately goes to fight Harley due to an old feud over a woman. After a manly exchange of blows and body slams, Harley tells him that he knows that the woman loves Jack and they make friends. Soon it is revealed that the bar is about to be demolished as the lease will not be renewed. \"Suits\" at Great Trust bank plan to replace it with a skyscraper. Harley, Marlboro, Jack and two friends decide to rob a bank to raise the money to ensure the bar's survival. A comely waitress hooks up with Harley. Marlboro borrows Harley's Harley and baits a motorcycle cop, with interesting results. In a bit of psychological revelation, we learn that he is in an intermittent amorous relationship with a beautiful woman, who tells him that she is going to settle down with another man, as she is not getting enough loving from him. He is conflicted by the news but later tells Harley that he is not the kind of man who has a wife. Harley arrives and takes her out for breakfast. An armored car is going down a street and meets a detour sign. Marlboro jumps on its back door and climbs to its roof (a visual parallel of train robbers crawling on the roofs of boxcars in old western movies). The contents of the armored car is heisted in a well-thought-out scheme, but the escape of Harley/Marlboro's gang is almost foiled by the appearance of a squad of black-trenchcoat-wearing (a la Matrix) machinepistol-firing soldiers. Jack drives a fiery motorcycle into the fray and allows them to escape. But they discover the goods they have stolen are a large amount of \"Crystal Dream\", not money. Chance Wilder (Tom Sizemore), president of the Great Trust branch, is obviously involved in drug dealing. Harley and Marlboro go to the bank. Showing considerable balls, Harley negotiates an exchange - the drugs for $2.5M. The exchange goes down smoothly in a visually-fascinating airplane graveyard, but then the bank's squad of soldiers finds them celebrating at the bar and it is not pretty, although Harley and Marlboro manage to escape with the money. In a running battle, Harley and Marlboro alternately flee and face off with steadily-declining elements of the squad until a final showdown in the penthouse suite of the Great Trust bank. The closing scene: Marlboro has gone back to rodeo bull-riding and Harley on his bike takes to the road, stopping only temporarily to pick up a ravishing and shapely hitchhiker who tells him she is going \"no place special\", a destination that Harley promises to take her.

{"id": "test482", "query": "what are the 4 types of nitrogenous bases", "human_answer": "In the biological sciences, nitrogenous bases are increasingly termed nucleobases because of their role in nucleic acids - their flat shape is particularly important when considering their roles as the building blocks of DNA and RNA. A set of five nitrogenous bases is used in the construction of nucleotides, which in turn build up the nucleic acids like DNA and RNA. These nitrogenous bases are adenine (A), uracil (U), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C). These nitrogenous bases hydrogen bond between opposing DNA strands to form the rungs of the \"twisted ladder\" or double helix of DNA or a biological catalyst that is found in the nucleotides. Adenine is always paired with thymine, and guanine is always paired with cytosine. These are known as base pairs. Uracil is only present in RNA, replacing thymine. Pyrimidines include thymine, cytosine, and uracil. They have a single ring structure. Purines include adenine and guanine. They have a double ring structure.

{"id": "test512", "query": "difference between small signal and large signal model", "human_answer": "\"Large signal\" is the opposite of \"small signal\", which means that the circuit can be reduced to a linearized equivalent circuit around its operating point with sufficient accuracy.", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "The small signal model and large signal model are two different methods used in analyzing electronic circuits, particularly those involving transistors. The main difference between the two lies in the type of signals they are designed to handle.\n\nThe small signal model is used when the signal variations around the Q-point (quiescent point) are small. This model linearizes the non-linear characteristics of the transistor around its operating point, making it easier to analyze. It is often used in frequency response analysis and for signals that are sinusoidal in nature.\n\nOn the other hand, the large signal model is used when the signal variations around the Q-point are large. This model takes into account the non-linear characteristics of the transistor. It is often used in time domain transient analysis and for signals that have a large amplitude or are not sinusoidal in nature. \n\nIn summary, the small signal model is used for small, linear signal variations, while the large signal model is used for large, non-linear signal variations."}

{"id": "test530", "query": "four basic rules regarding the practice of sovereignty", "human_answer": "However, although he is often connected with absolutism, Bodin held some moderate opinions on how government should in practice be carried out. He held that although the sovereign is not obliged to, it is advisable for him, as a practical expedient, to convene a senate from whom he can obtain advice, to delegate some power to magistrates for the practical administration of the law, and to use the Estates as a means of communicating with the people.[citation needed] Furthermore, he emphasized that a sovereign is bound to observe certain basic rules derived from the divine law, the law of nature or reason, and the law that is common to all nations (jus gentium), as well as the fundamental laws of the state that determine who is the sovereign, who succeeds to sovereignty, and what limits the sovereign power. Thus, Bodin’s sovereign was restricted by the constitutional law of the state and by the higher law that was considered as binding upon every human being.[1] Bodin believed that “the most divine, most excellent, and the state form most proper to royalty is governed partly aristocratically and partly democratically”.[10] With his doctrine that sovereignty is conferred by divine law, Bodin predefined the scope of the divine right of kings.[citation needed]", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "The practice of sovereignty is guided by four basic rules. Firstly, sovereignty implies absolute authority within a state's territorial boundaries. This means that the state has the power to make and enforce laws without external interference. Secondly, sovereignty is indivisible. It cannot be shared or divided among different entities. Thirdly, sovereignty is inalienable, meaning it cannot be transferred or surrendered to another entity.

{"id": "test531", "query": "why is bronze preferred over copper metal for making statues", "human_answer": "Common bronze alloys have the unusual and desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling the finest details of a mould. Then, as the bronze cools, it shrinks a little, making it easier to separate from the mould.[1] Their strength and ductility (lack of brittleness) is an advantage when figures in action are to be created, especially when compared to various ceramic or stone materials (such as marble sculpture). These qualities allow the creation of extended figures, as in JetÃ©, or figures that have small cross sections in their support, such as the equestrian statue of Richard the Lionheart.[2]", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "Bronze is preferred over copper for making statues due to several reasons. Firstly, bronze is more durable and stronger than copper, making it more suitable for creating large structures that need to withstand the elements. Secondly, bronze has a more desirable color and sheen, which can create a more visually appealing statue. Lastly, bronze is more resistant to corrosion than copper, which means a bronze statue will maintain its appearance for a longer period of time."}

The first three volumes of the Course dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence (mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of social science. Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, Comte may be regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term.[10] Comte was also the first to distinguish natural philosophy from science explicitly. For him, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex \"Queen science\" of human society itself.

{"id": "test544", "query": "where is fight or flight in the brain", "human_answer": "The reaction begins in the amygdala, which triggers a neural response in the hypothalamus. The initial reaction is followed by activation of the pituitary gland and secretion of the hormone ACTH.[9] The adrenal gland is activated almost simultaneously, via the sympathetic nervous system, and releases the hormone epinephrine. The release of chemical messengers results in the production of the hormone cortisol, which increases blood pressure, blood sugar, and suppresses the immune system.[10] The initial response and subsequent reactions are triggered in an effort to create a boost of energy. This boost of energy is activated by epinephrine binding to liver cells and the subsequent production of glucose.[11] Additionally, the circulation of cortisol functions to turn fatty acids into available energy, which prepares muscles throughout the body for response.[12] Catecholamine hormones, such as adrenaline (epinephrine) or noradrenaline (norepinephrine), facilitate immediate physical reactions associated with a preparation for violent muscular action andÂ :[13]", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "The fight or flight response is primarily triggered in the brain's hypothalamus.

{"id": "test553", "query": "what was the united states foreign policy after ww1 started", "human_answer": "American foreign policy was largely determined by President Woodrow Wilson, who had shown little interest in foreign affairs before entering the White House in 1913. His chief advisor was \"Colonel\" Edward House, who was sent on many top-level missions. With the outbreak of war in 1914, the United States declared neutrality and worked to broker a peace. It insisted on its neutral rights, which included allowing private corporations and banks to sell or loan money to either side. With the British blockade, there were almost no sales or loans to Germany, only to the Allies. The widely publicized German atrocities in Germany Shocked American public opinion. Neutrality was supported by Irish-Americans, who hated Britain, by German Americans who wanted to remain neutral, and by women and the churches. It was supported by the more educated upscale WASP element, led by Theodore Roosevelt. Wilson insisted on neutrality, denouncing both British and German violations, especially those German violations in which American civilians were killed. The German U-boat torpedoed the RMS Lusitania in 1915. It sank in 20 minutes, killing killed 128 American civilians and over 1000 Britons. It was against the laws of war to sink any passenger ship without allowing the passengers to reach the life boats. American opinion turned strongly against Germany as a bloodthirsty threat to civilization.[38] Germany apologized and repeatedly promised to stop attacks by its U-boats, but reversed course in early 1917 when it saw the opportunity to strangle Britain by unrestricted submarine warfare. It also made overtures to Mexico, in the Zimmermann Telegram, hoping to divert American military attention to south of the border. The German decision was not made or approved by the civilian government in Berlin, the by the military commanders and the Kaiser. They realized it meant war with the United States, but hoped to weaken the British by cutting off its imports, and strike a winning below with German soldiers transferred from the Eastern front, where Russia had surrendered. Following the repeated sinking of American merchant ships in early 1917, Wilson asked and obtained a declaration of war in April 1917. He neutralized the antiwar element by arguing this was a war With the main goal of ending aggressive militarism and indeed ending all wars. During the war the U.S. was not officially tied to the Allies by treaty, but military cooperation meant that the American contribution became significant in mid-1918. After the failure of the German spring offensive, as fresh American troops arrived in France at 10,000 a day, the Germans were in a hopeless position, and surrendered. Coupled with Wilson's Fourteen Points in January 1918, the U.S. now had the initiative on the military, diplomatic and public relations fronts. Wilsonianism-- Wilson's ideals--had become the hope of the world, including the civilian population Germany itself.[39]", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "After World War 1 started, the United States initially adopted a policy of neutrality and isolationism. President Woodrow Wilson declared the U.S. neutral in 1914, aiming to keep the country out of the conflict and protect American lives and economic interests. However, as the war progressed, unrestricted submarine warfare by Germany and other factors led to a shift in U.S. foreign policy. In 1917, the U.S. entered the war on the side of the Allies. After the war, the U.S. sought to play a larger role in international affairs, but the Senate rejected U.S. participation in the League of Nations, marking a return to isolationism."}

{"id": "test564", "query": "опишите, как терморегуляция отличается у эктотермов и эндотермов", "human_answer": "Терморегуляция в организмах проходит по спектру от эндотермии до эктотермии. Эндотермы создают большую часть своего тепла за счет метаболических процессов и обычно называются теплокровными. Когда окружающая температура холодная, эндотермы увеличивают производство тепла за счет метаболизма, чтобы поддерживать постоянную температуру тела, делая внутреннюю температуру тела эндотерма более или менее независимой от температуры окружающей среды. Одна из метаболических активностей, которую эндотермы могут выполнять для генерации тепла, заключается в том, что у них больше митохондрий на клетку, чем у эктотермов, что позволяет им генерировать больше тепла, увеличивая скорость метаболизма жиров и сахаров. Эктотермы используют внешние источники температуры для регулирования температуры своего тела. Их обычно называют холоднокровными, несмотря на то, что температура тела часто остается в тех же диапазонах температур, что и у теплокровных животных. Эктотермы - противоположность эндотермов в отношении регулирования внутренних температур. У эктотермов внутренние физиологические источники тепла имеют незначительное значение; наибольший фактор, который позволяет им поддерживать адекватную температуру тела, связан с влиянием окружающей среды. Жизнь в районах, которые поддерживают постоянную температуру в течение всего года, таких как тропики или океан, позволила эктотермам развить широкий спектр поведенческих механизмов, которые позволяют им реагировать на внешние температуры, такие как загорание для повышения температуры тела или поиск тени для снижения температуры тела.", "language": "ru", "llm_answer": "Терморегуляция у эктотермов и эндотермов отличается.

Они могут поддерживать постоянную температуру тела независимо от температуры окружающей среды. Это позволяет им оставаться активными в широком диапазоне температур."}

It may be described as the sharing of free electrons among a lattice of positively charged ions (cations). Metallic bonding accounts for many physical properties of metals, such as strength, ductility, thermal and electrical resistivity and conductivity, opacity, and luster.[1][2][3][4]", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "Metallic bonding results in several useful properties of metals. Firstly, it leads to high electrical and thermal conductivity. This is because the electrons in the 'sea' of electrons in metallic bonding are free to move and carry electrical charge or thermal energy. Secondly, metallic bonding results in metals being malleable and ductile. This is due to the layers of atoms in metals being able to slide over each other without breaking the metallic bonds. Thirdly, metallic bonding leads to metals having a high melting and boiling point because a lot of energy is needed to break the strong metallic bonds. Lastly, the shiny appearance of metals is also due to metallic bonding, as the delocalized electrons can reflect light."}

{"id": "test615", "query": "this type of nuclear decay effectively turns a proton into a neutron", "human_answer": "In nuclear physics, beta decay (β-decay) is a type of radioactive decay in which a beta ray (fast energetic electron or positron) and a neutrino are emitted from an atomic nucleus. For example, beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron, or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron (positron emission), thus changing the nuclide type. Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay, but are created in the decay process. By this process, unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons. The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its nuclear binding energy. The binding energies of all existing nuclides form what is called the nuclear band or valley of stability.[1] For either electron or positron emission to be energetically possible, the energy release (see below) or Q value must be positive.", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "The type of nuclear decay that effectively turns a proton into a neutron is known as Beta Plus Decay, or Positron Emission. In this process, a proton in an unstable nucleus is converted into a neutron, a positron, and a neutrino. The positron is the antimatter counterpart of an electron.

Therefore, it makes an excellent fixed point from which to draw measurements for celestial navigation and for astrometry. The moving of Polaris towards and, in the future, away from the celestial pole, is due to the precession of the equinoxes.[24] The celestial pole will move away from α UMi after the 21st century, passing close by Gamma Cephei by about the 41st century, moving towards Deneb by about the 91st century. Historically, the celestial pole was close to Thuban around 2750 BC,[24] and during classical antiquity it was closer to Kochab (β UMi) than to Polaris.[25] It was about the same angular distance from β UMi as to α UMi by the end of late antiquity. The Greek navigator Pytheas in ca. 320 BC described the celestial pole as devoid of stars. However, as one of the brighter stars close to the celestial pole, Polaris was used for navigation at least from late antiquity, and described as ἀεί φανής (aei phanēs) \"always visible\" by Stobaeus (5th century), and it could reasonably be described as stella polaris from about the High Middle Ages.", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "At the North Pole, Polaris, also known as the North Star, is visible directly overhead.

Since freshman and junior varsity points do not count toward official NCAA records, three players—Pete Maravich, Oscar Robertson and Elvin Hayes—only had three seasons to compile their totals. Larry Bird redshirted (sat out) his freshman year, and therefore, like Maravich, Robertson, and Hayes, his totals also cover only three seasons (though in Bird's case, unlike the others, it was his own choice not to play a fourth season at the college level).

The same sequence of reactions is widely used in the laboratory to convert RNA to DNA for use in molecular cloning, RNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or genome analysis.", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "Reverse transcriptase plays a crucial role in the life cycle of a retrovirus, which is a type of virus that uses RNA as its genetic material instead of DNA. When a retrovirus infects a cell, it releases its RNA into the cell's cytoplasm. The reverse transcriptase enzyme then converts this viral RNA into DNA, a process known as reverse transcription. This newly formed viral DNA is transported into the cell's nucleus where it integrates into the host cell's DNA with the help of another viral enzyme called integrase. This allows the virus to replicate and produce more viruses when the host cell divides. Therefore, reverse transcriptase is essential for a retroviral infection as it enables the virus to reproduce within host cells."}

From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan.

A Provisional Central Government was formed in 1948, reuniting Annam and Tonkin, but the complete reunification of Vietnam was delayed for a year because of the problems posed by Cochinchina's legal status. In July 1949, the State of Vietnam was officially proclaimed, as a semi-independent country within the French Union, with Bảo Đại as Head of State. France was finally persuaded to relinquish its colonies in Indochina in 1954 when Viet Minh forces defeated the French at Dien Bien Phu. The 1954 Geneva Conference left Vietnam a divided nation, with Hồ Chí Minh's communist DRV government ruling the North from Hanoi and Ngô Đình Diệm's Republic of Vietnam, supported by the United States, ruling the South from Saigon. Between 1953 and 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms, including \"rent reduction\" and \"land reform\", which resulted in significant political oppression. During the land reform, testimony from North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160 village residents, which extrapolated nationwide would indicate nearly 100,000 executions. Because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the Red River Delta area, a lower estimate of 50,000 executions became widely accepted by scholars at the time.[32][33][34][35] However, declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time, although likely greater than 13,500.[36] In the South, Diem went about crushing political and religious opposition, imprisoning or killing tens of thousands.[37]", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "The first imperial power that was fighting in Vietnam was France.

The result of the intrusion of North American fauna was that hundreds of South American species became extinct in a relatively short time and that about 60% of present-day South American mammals have evolved from North American species.[3] However, some species were able to adapt and spread into North America. Apart from Pliometanastes, during the Irvingtonian stage of the mammal land stages, around 1.9Â Ma, species as Pampatherium, a giant armadillo, ground sloth Megatherium, giant anteater Myrmecophaga, a Neogene capybara (Hydrochoerus), Meizonyx, opossum Didelphis, and Mixotoxodon followed the route north.[4] The terror bird Titanis was the only discovered South American carnivore species who made the journey into North America.[5]", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "South America took the form that it has today around 3 million years ago.

One such method is the creation of propaganda. Propaganda is a powerful tool used to shape public opinion and generate support for the war effort. It is often disseminated through various mediums such as posters, films, radio broadcasts, and newspapers. The messages conveyed through propaganda typically emphasize the importance of the war and the necessity of victory. In addition to rallying support for the war effort, propaganda is also used to encourage the sale of war bonds. War bonds are debt securities issued by the government to finance military operations during times of war. By purchasing these bonds, citizens are essentially lending money to the government with the promise of a return on investment. The sale of war bonds is crucial as it provides the necessary funds for the war effort.

It acts as a two-carbon donor in the elongation cycle of fatty acid synthesis. The process begins with the carboxylation of acetyl CoA to form malonyl CoA, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme acetyl CoA carboxylase. This is the rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis. The malonyl CoA then enters a cycle of reactions where it is repeatedly condensed with growing fatty acid chains, adding two carbons at each cycle until the final product, a long-chain fatty acid, is produced.

{"id": "test805", "query": "describe the three phases of the normal blood clotting process", "human_answer": "Hemostasis occurs when blood is present outside of the body or blood vessels. It is the instinctive response for the body to stop bleeding and loss of blood. During hemostasis three steps occur in a rapid sequence. Vascular spasm is the first response as the blood vessels constrict to allow less blood to be lost. In the second step, platelet plug formation, platelets stick together to form a temporary seal to cover the break in the vessel wall. The third and last step is called coagulation or blood clotting. Coagulation reinforces the platelet plug with fibrin threads that act as a \"molecular glue\".[3] Platelets are a large factor in the hemostatic process. They allow for the creation of the \"platelet plug\" that forms almost directly after a blood vessel has been ruptured. Within seconds of a blood vessel's epithelial wall being disrupted platelets begin to adhere to the sub-endothelium surface. It takes approximately sixty seconds until the first fibrin strands begin to intersperse among the wound. After several minutes the platelet plug is completely formed by fibrin.[4] Hemostasis is maintained in the body via three mechanisms:", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "The normal blood clotting process, also known as coagulation, occurs in three main phases: the vascular phase, the platelet phase, and the coagulation phase. \n\nThe first phase, the vascular phase, occurs immediately after a blood vessel is injured. The vessel constricts to limit the flow of blood to the damaged area. \n\nThe second phase, the platelet phase, involves the accumulation of platelets at the site of the injury to form a temporary plug. The platelets stick to the exposed collagen fibers of the damaged vessel, change shape to become more sticky, and release chemicals that attract more platelets to the site. \n\nThe third phase, the coagulation phase, involves a complex cascade of chemical reactions that result in the formation of fibrin strands. These strands strengthen and stabilize the platelet plug, forming a more permanent clot. This clot prevents further blood loss until the damaged vessel can be repaired. \n\nOnce the vessel is healed, the clot is broken down and removed in a process called fibrinolysis."}
{"id": "test806", "query": "the tectonic process responsible for creating the vast canyon system on mars is", "human_answer": "The formation of Valles Marineris is thought to be closely tied with the formation of the Tharsis Bulge. The Tharsis Bulge was formed from the Noachian to Late Hesperian period of Mars, in three stages. The first stage consisted of a combination of volcanism and isostatic uplift; soon, however, the volcanism loaded the crust to a point at which the crust could no longer support the added weight of Tharsis, leading to widespread graben formation in the elevated regions of Tharsis. Stage two consisted of more volcanism and a loss of isostatic equilibrium; the source regions of the volcanism no longer resided underneath Tharsis, creating a very large load. Finally, the crust failed to hold up Tharsis and radial fractures formed, including at Valles Marineris. Stage three mainly consisted of more volcanism and asteroid impacts. The crust, having already reached its failure point, just stayed in place and younger volcanoes formed. Tharsis volcanism involved very low viscosity magma, forming shield volcanoes similar to those of the Hawaiian Island chain, but, because there is minor or no current active plate tectonics on Mars, the hotspot activity led to very long histories of repeated volcanic eruptions at the same spots, creating some of the largest volcanoes in the solar system, including the biggest, Olympus Mons.[8]", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "The tectonic process responsible for creating the vast canyon system on Mars is known as rift formation. This process involves the stretching and cracking of the planet's crust due to internal geological forces. Over time, these cracks can widen and deepen to form canyons.

{"id": "test808", "query": "who created separation of powers and checks and balances", "human_answer": "Checks and balances is the principle that each of the Branches has the power to limit or check the other two and this creates a balance between the three separate powers of the state, this principle induces that the ambitions of one branch prevent that one of the other branches become supreme, and thus be eternally confronting each other and in that process leaving the people free from government abuses. Checks and Balances are designed to maintain the system of separation of powers keeping each branch in its place. This is based on the idea that it is not enough to separate the powers and guarantee their independence but to give the various branches the constitutional means to defend their own legitimate powers from the encroachments of the other branches.[15] They guarantee that the powers of the State have the same weight (co-equal), that is, to be balanced, so that they can limit each other, avoiding the abuse of state power. the origin of checks and balances, like separation of powers itself, is specifically credited to Montesquieu in the Enlightenment (in The Spirit of the Laws, 1748), under this influence was implemented in 1787 in the Constitution of the United States.", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "The concept of separation of powers and checks and balances was created by French philosopher Baron de Montesquieu in his book \"The Spirit of the Laws\" published in 1748.

{"id": "test814", "query": "if a piece of music is perceived to have changed key then we say the piece has", "human_answer": "In traditional Western notation, the scale used for a composition is usually indicated by a key signature at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale. As the music progresses, the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale. Music can be transposed from one scale to another for various purposes, often to accommodate the range of a vocalist. Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range, but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a whole tone. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch range compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music.

The idea dates originally to the general-king Gustavus Adolphus (1594â€“1632) who gave standing orders to his musketeers: \"never to give fire, till they could see their own image in the pupil of their enemy's eye\".[103] Gustavus Adolphus's military teachings were widely admired and imitated and caused this saying to be often repeated. It was used by General James Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham, when his troops defeated Montcalm's army on September 13, 1759.[104] The earliest similar quote came from the Battle of Dettingen on June 27, 1743, where Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Andrew Agnew of Lochnaw warned his Regiment, the Royal Scots Fusiliers, not to fire until they could \"see the white of their e'en.\"[105] The phrase was also used by Prince Charles of Prussia in 1745, and repeated in 1755 by Frederick the Great, and may have been mentioned in histories the colonial military leaders were familiar with.[106] Whether or not it was actually said in this battle, it was clear that the colonial military leadership were regularly reminding their troops to hold their fire until the moment when it would have the greatest effect, especially in situations where their ammunition would be limited.[107]", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "The phrase \"Don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes\" is attributed to American Revolutionary War officer William Prescott.

Но тъй като Бразилия се намира в Южното полукълбо, бразилците празнуват Коледа през лятото. В малките градове в цялата страна, както и в най-големите градове, като Сао Пауло, Рио де Жанейро, Ресифе, Салвадор, Форталеза, Куритиба, Порто Алегре, Бразилия, Манаус, Белем, Натал и Бело Оризонте, празнуванията по много начини приличат на традициите в Европа и Северна Америка, с коледната елха, размяната на подаръци и коледни картички, украсата на къщи и сгради с електрически светлини и изображението на рождественската сцена. Въпреки топлото тропическо лятно време, някои несъответствия като декорации с теми за зима и сняг не са необичайни. В някои градове като Гуарапуава има конкурси за декорация, когато съдиите отиват на домове, за да разгледат декорациите, вътре или извън къщата, и да определят най-красивата къща. Коледната нощ е най-важният ден. За разлика от северноамериканската и англосаксонската традиция, Коледа се провежда предимно около полунощ, обикновено с големи семейни вечери, отваряне на подаръци и празнуване на \"Missa do Galo\" (петеловата маса) в църкви по цялата страна.", "language": "bg", "llm_answer": "Символът за Коледа в Бразилия е \"Papai Noel\" или Дядо Коледа.

Sandford case was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court in 1857. Dred Scott, an enslaved African American man, had been taken by his owners to free states and territories, where he attempted to sue for his freedom. The court ruled that, as a black man, Scott was not a citizen and therefore had no right to sue. The decision also declared the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which had restricted slavery in certain territories, unconstitutional.

Many lots are rectangular in shape, although other shapes are possible as long as the boundaries are well-defined. Methods of determining or documenting the boundaries of lots include metes and bounds, quadrant method, and use of a plat diagram. Use of the metes and bounds method may be compared to drawing a polygon. Metes are points which are like the vertices (corners) of a polygon. Bounds are line segments between two adjacent metes. Bounds are usually straight lines, but can be curved as long as they are clearly defined.", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "The size of a plot of land can vary greatly depending on its location and intended use.

{"id": "test917", "query": "what is the role of anaerobic respiration in living things", "human_answer": "Cellular respiration (both aerobic and anaerobic) utilizes highly reduced chemical compounds such as NADH and FADH2 (for example produced during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle) to establish an electrochemical gradient (often a proton gradient) across a membrane, resulting in an electrical potential or ion concentration difference across the membrane. The reduced chemical compounds are oxidized by a series of respiratory integral membrane proteins with sequentially increasing reduction potentials with the final electron acceptor being oxygen (in aerobic respiration) or another chemical substance (in anaerobic respiration). A proton motive force drives protons down the gradient (across the membrane) through the proton channel of ATP synthase. The resulting current drives ATP synthesis from ADP and inorganic phosphate.", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "Anaerobic respiration plays a crucial role in living organisms, particularly in conditions where oxygen is scarce or absent. It allows cells to generate energy without the need for oxygen. This process is particularly important for certain types of bacteria, yeasts, and muscle cells. In bacteria and yeasts, anaerobic respiration is used to produce energy and various end products that are essential for their survival and growth. In human muscle cells, during intense exercise when oxygen supply is limited, anaerobic respiration provides the energy needed for muscle contraction. However, it produces lactic acid as a byproduct, which can cause muscle fatigue. Thus, anaerobic respiration is a vital biological process that enables organisms to survive and function in low-oxygen environments."}

South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate. The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans, because of it being higher than the age of majority (18 in most states) and higher than the drinking ages of most other countries. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act is also seen as a congressional sidestep of the tenth amendment.

{"id": "test970", "query": "what is the result of electrical stimulation to the reticular formation", "human_answer": "The main function of the ARAS is to modify and potentiate thalamic and cortical function such that electroencephalogram (EEG) desynchronization ensues.[24][25] There are distinct differences in the brain’s electrical activity during periods of wakefulness and sleep: Low voltage fast burst brain waves (EEG desynchronization) are associated with wakefulness and REM sleep (which are electrophysiologically similar); high voltage slow waves are found during non-REM sleep. Generally speaking, when thalamic relay neurons are in burst mode the EEG is synchronized and when they are in tonic mode it is desynchronized.[25] Stimulation of the ARAS produces EEG desynchronization by suppressing slow cortical waves (0.3–1 Hz), delta waves (1–4 Hz), and spindle wave oscillations (11–14 Hz) and by promoting gamma band (20 – 40 Hz) oscillations.[16]", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "Electrical stimulation to the reticular formation can result in immediate changes in the state of consciousness. It can cause a sleeping individual to wake up or an awake individual to fall asleep.

Axons make contact with other cells—usually other neurons but sometimes muscle or gland cells—at junctions called synapses. In some circumstances, the axon of one neuron may form a synapse with the dendrites of the same neuron, resulting in an autapse. At a synapse, the membrane of the axon closely adjoins the membrane of the target cell, and special molecular structures serve to transmit electrical or electrochemical signals across the gap.

{"id": "test992", "query": "where does the spinal cord become cauda equina", "human_answer": "The cauda equina (Latin for \"horse's tail\") is a bundle of spinal nerves and spinal nerve rootlets, consisting of the second through fifth lumbar nerve pairs, the first through fifth sacral nerve pairs, and the coccygeal nerve, all of which arise from the lumbar enlargement and the conus medullaris of the spinal cord. The cauda equina occupies the lumbar cistern, a subarachnoid space inferior to the conus medullaris. The nerves that compose the cauda equina innervate the pelvic organs and lower limbs to include motor innervation of the hips, knees, ankles, feet, internal anal sphincter and external anal sphincter. In addition, the cauda equina extends to sensory innervation of the perineum and, partially, parasympathetic innervation of the bladder.[1]", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "The spinal cord becomes the cauda equina at the level of the first lumbar vertebra (L1).

{"id": "test1026", "query": "anastomosis between the epididymis and the vas deferens", "human_answer": "Vasoepididymostomy is often considered one of the most technically challenging operations in the field of urology. The procedure requires anastomosis of a single epididymal tubule (luminal diameter .15-.25 mm) to the lumen of the vas deferens (diameter .3-.4 mm), and is reserved for patients with congenital or acquired epididymal obstruction, or patients who have failed previous attempts at surgical reconstruction of the vas deferens. This surgery attaches the vas deferens directly to the epididymis, the coiled tube on the back of each testicle where sperm matures. A vasectomy can cause blockages or a break in the vas deferens or the epididymis. This surgery is used when a vasovasostomy won't work because sperm flow is blocked. The vas deferens is connected to the epididymis above the point of blockage.", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "Anastomosis between the epididymis and the vas deferens refers to a surgical connection made between these two parts of the male reproductive system. This procedure is often performed to restore fertility in men who have had a vasectomy, a surgical procedure for male sterilization or permanent contraception. The anastomosis allows sperm to once again travel from the epididymis, where it matures, into the vas deferens, from where it can be ejaculated. This procedure is complex and requires a skilled surgeon, as both the epididymis and the vas deferens are small and delicate structures."}

Tywin bitterly claims that he had wanted to drown Tyrion upon birth, but stayed himself for the sake of duty. In season 4, Tyrion welcomes Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne to King's Landing for Joffrey's wedding to Margaery Tyrell, though Oberyn implies to Tyrion that his true purpose is to seek vengeance for his sister, who was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane on Tywin's orders. When Joffrey is fatally poisoned, Tyrion is framed and arrested. Tyrion, however, implies that Cersei knows of his innocence and just wants him dead. At Tyrion's trial, he demands a trial by combat. Tyrion is approached by Oberyn, who volunteers to be his champion in order to fight Cersei's champion, Ser Gregor Clegane. When Oberyn loses the fight and is killed, Tyrion is sentenced to death. Jaime, however, frees Tyrion and arranges for him to escape King's Landing. Tyrion goes to confront Tywin in his chambers but finds Shae, who testified against him and is now Tywin's lover. After a brief struggle, Tyrion strangles Shae to death, and Tyrion shoots Tywin to death with Joffrey's crossbow. Tyrion is then placed in a crate and smuggled off to Essos with help from Varys. They arrive in Pentos, where Varys manages to convince Tyrion to travel with him to Meereen and aid Daenerys Targaryen in retaking the Iron Throne. Tyrion is bound and gagged by Jorah Mormont, who says that he will take him to Daenerys. Daenerys takes them both to her home in the Great Pyramid of Meereen and asks Tyrion why he is here. Tyrion tells her everything, including Varys' plan. He initially counsels her to stay in Meereen, but Daenerys makes it plain to him that her eyes are still on Westeros. Tyrion tells Daenerys how hard it will be to win the love of both the common people and the nobles. He later joins her at the opening celebrations of Daznak's Pit, where Jorah unexpectedly reappears to defeat every other foe on the arena. As the Sons of the Harpy attack, Tyrion manages to survive by fleeing to the midst of the arena, where they are rescued by Drogon, while Daenerys is spirited away on his back. In season 6, Tyrion struggles to maintain peace in Meereen, particularly when the Sons of the Harpy burn the entire Meereenese Navy, stranding them in Slaver's Bay. Following an alliance with Theon and Yara Greyjoy, Tyrion advises Daenerys to break up with Daario so that she may pursue a marriage alliance in Westeros. In gratitude for Tyrion's loyalty, Daenerys names him her official Hand, and he accompanies her back to Westeros. In season 7 Tyrion's advice to Daenerys often conflicts with her views, and he has mixed success in directing her actions. He sneaks into King's Landing and meets with Jamie to set up a meeting between Cersei and Daenerys, which eventually happens in the Dragonpit outside the city. At the meeting a captured wight is produced to convince Cersei that the worst threat is from beyond the Wall. When Cersei is not convinced, Tyrion risks execution to meet with his sister to try again to persuade her. He is unexpectedly allowed to leave Cersei's presence alive, and thinks he has secured an agreement from her to help with the fight against the Wight Walkers.", "language": "en", "llm_answer": "In the Game of Thrones series, the dwarf's name is Tyrion Lannister."}

In a neutral or alkaline solution, methyl red is yellow. However, in an acidic environment, it turns red. This is because the acidic environment increases the concentration of hydrogen ions, which react with the methyl red molecules and cause them to ionize. This ionization changes the structure of the molecule, which in turn changes the wavelengths of light it absorbs and thus its color. Therefore, by observing the color of a solution containing methyl red, one can determine whether the solution is acidic or neutral/alkaline."}
